# Code Refactor

## Description

The purpose of this project is to optimize the clients webpage for better accessibility in order to boost the clients SEO rating. Web accessibility is an increasingly important part of any web application. It ensures people with disabilities can use assistive technologies to have better access to a web application. In order to do this it will require a full refactoring of the webpages code base which will include improving semantic structure, and organizing stylesheets to avoid unnecessary repetition.
